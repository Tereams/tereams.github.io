        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          	  Welcome! I’m Terry Chen, a 
		  <strong>master’s student in Computer Science at Rice University</strong>. 
		  My strengths are in <strong>data analysis</strong> and 
		  <strong>machine learning</strong>, and I enjoy applying computational 
		  methods to challenging problems. Beyond computer science, I have a deep 
		  interest in <strong>physics</strong> and enjoy self-studying topics ranging 
		  from classical mechanics and quantum mechanics to quantum field theory 
		  and cosmology. Recently, I’ve been exploring 
		  <strong>machine learning approaches for physics-related problems</strong>.
          </p>
